#RPG-Web-Page-With-Dice-Roller
*A Web Page in Portuguese with dices on the last page - and the dices are actually working
*
*It took me around 4 days to finish because I've forgotten to put "type=text/javascript" inside the Link tag from the HTML page for the dices. 
*It still has some appearance issues, I was focusing more on making the dices work and didn't want an empty page. 
*
*I'm looking through improving the CSS and really preferred working with each part separated, so one folder for js codes, one for CSS and separated files for each page
